 * When wanting to override a touch area you can set an interface to be called
 * instead of having to override the method on creation. <br>
 * Useful for when creating entities which are derived from {@link Shape}. <br>
 * You can set the listener by calling
 * {@link Shape#setOnTouchAreaInterface(ITouchAreaListener)} <br>
 * Reason for creating such a thing? because overriding is ugly.
